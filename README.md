# Tabula Rasa

Streamline how you review, sort, and close Firefox tabs. Tabula Rasa presents a fast, keyboard-friendly list of the tabs in your current window so you can decide what stays open and what goes. The project lives at [github.com/fejikso/tabula_rasa_firefox_extension](https://github.com/fejikso/tabula_rasa_firefox_extension).

## Quick Start

1. Click the Tabula Rasa toolbar icon (popup view) or press **F8** (full-page view).  
2. Filter tabs by typing in the search box – use **Esc** to clear the query.  
3. Press **1 / 2 / 3** to switch between browser order, most recently used, or oldest tabs first.  
4. Tick the tabs you want to close and hit **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**, or click the ❌ next to any single tab to close it immediately.  
5. Want the full-page layout by default? Open the full view and enable **“Always open Tabula Rasa in full view.”**
